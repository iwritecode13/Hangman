# Hangman
The hangman game, made using tkinter

Note that this might not work, I am still working on this project, I'm fixing little things but in the meantime it could be 'broken'.

The 'quit' button is buggy right now, I'm working on it.

The 'real' readme:

Written in Python (3.8.4rc1) and tkinter()

Versions:
Python: 3.4.8rc1
tkinter(tk): 0.1.0
PIL(Pillow):  8.0.0
dutch_words(dutch_words): 1.7.1

Library's you need to install:
tkinter         pip install tk
PIL             pip install Pillow
dutch_words     pip install dutch_words


How to game works:
When you first start the program, you need to select a language on the right side of the screen
Then you need to select the entry box and guess letters (this is done by typing a letter,
then typing the enter/return key on your keyboard).

Then when you've either succeded or failed in guessing the word, you need to press enter and 
repeat everything again.

Also quick note:
There might be little mistakes in the code, and it's (probably definitely  ) not written very efficiently

If the english word library (this is the file called 'words.py') is not working, you can always paste the contents of the file in the main code file.
